## About

This site was created to house blog posts for random ideas that I have as well as become a showcase for small games or game ideas that I create. In my free time I enjoy brewing beer, snowboarding, playing and creating video games, and wasting countless hours on youtube. I hodl and follow cryptos as well.

As for my background, I originally attended PSU for Engineering Science with a focus on Engineering Mechanics. I then worked for two years as an Electromechancial Engineer developing circuit card assembly testing systems, automating them with Arduino microcontrollers, and modeling vibration test fixtures for various items. During my employement, I gained an appreciation for programming and decided to return to school in order to strengthen my coding skills and hopefully find a job in the industry.
